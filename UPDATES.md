# Updates and changes

1. Sept 2023:

* Many safety enhancements. Most important, this driver is now thread-safe. It can be called simultaneously from multiple processes, while returning the correct results to each. Also, better deadlock prevention and generally safety and sanity checks.
* Now not only can a foreign CR3 be specified in VTOP, but you can also rely on the CR3 info service from Linpmem to acquire said CR3 from any running foreign process.
* There is a basic Linpmem shell (Linpmem-cli) you can use now. It implements all basic functionalities from Linpmem and can also be used as library. 


25. July 2023:

* Enabled using a foreign CR3 in the VTOP translation service. Leave it to zero for default CR3. (See linpmem_shared.h, struct `LINPMEM_VTOP_INFO`, field `associated_cr3`). Use at your own risk!
* Foreign CR3's can currently be acquired by inserting a thread into another process in gentlemen agreement, and calling Linpmem for CR3 query from there. There is no extra service.
* Made precompiler switches consistent. Commenting a precompiler switch always disables it.

* Initial commit
